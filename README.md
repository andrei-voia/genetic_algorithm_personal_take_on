# Genetic Algorithm personal take-on

* A program that can find, as the generations passes, better and better ways of training a graph for a machine learning based algorithm in a natural selection manner.
* Mutations take place in every generation in different percentages, but the best of the current generation always remains and multiplies.
* Therefore the general population grows better and better.
* The parameters are easy to change because of their definition in a separate method.
